  We chose a venue in a small town, Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne, near Lyon, in France.
  We will have very good hosting conditions at a correct price:
    - 4 rooms equiped with video (one of them able to welcome everyone)
    - Roof-top outdoor
    - Bedrooms for everyone in the same venue
    - Breakfasts, lunches and dinners with great chief (who knowns how to cook special requests : vege, vegan...)

  The unconference price includes 3 night stay, meals and rooms for the unconference.
