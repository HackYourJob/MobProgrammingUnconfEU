  The conference will take place in the region called Beaujolais, as the name of a "famous" wine.
  It is near Lyon, the city of lights (cinematograph was invented there!) and gastonomy.

  If you want to stay a bit longer, you could:
    - [visit Lyon](https://en.lyon-france.com/), part of UNESCO's World Heritage - only 25min train ride from Villefranche-sur-Saöne
    - eat in one of its "bouchons" (classic french cuisine from Lyon)
    - visit the Beaujolais contryside (there is not only "Beaujolais nouveau", there are much better wines!) - probably need to rent a car or bikes ;)
    - go in the Alps (~2 hours car ride)

  We let you choose your hotel, but we let you know that you can ask for our unconference deal [in the same hotel](https://all.accor.com/hotel/9783/index.fr.shtml#origin=mercure) (if you book before the event, directly with the hotel by phone/email - not through online booking - or ask us some help):
    - Single room: 100€/night including breakfast
    - Double or twin room: 110€/night including breakfast
